#____________________THE FINDINGS____________________#
Human-Mouse:
    Alignment score: 1091
    Average score per amino acid: 4.91
    Percentage of identical	amino acids: 89.64%

Human-Random:
    Alignment score: -250
    Average score per amino acid: -1.13
    Percentage of identical	amino acids: 5.41%

Mouse-Random:
    Alignment score: -250
    Average score per amino acid: -1.13
    Percentage of identical	amino acids: 5.86%

NOTE: Average score per amino acid is a way I think is meaningful to compare the similarity between proteins of different length.

#_________________THE INTERPRETATION_________________#
The result shows that mice and human have highly similar SOD2 protein. 
This may suggest that mice and us are evolutionarily similar. Our ancestors and the ancestors of mice separated late in their evolution.
So, in many cases, mice can be a good animal model to research human diseases.
