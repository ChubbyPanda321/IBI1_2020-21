Reflections about Practical4

Problems:
    1. Merge conflict occur when I tried to merge 2 branch.
        Solution: I fixed the conflict manully and merged successfully.
    2. Network problems prevented me from using "git clone" and "git push".
        Solution: Download the files from the server and upload them using VPN.

Summary:
    I learned how to use git and improved my online searching skill.
