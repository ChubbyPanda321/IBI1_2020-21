# This is a feedback of what I have done to my formative assessment.

## Changes I made
1. In Practical5/mystery_code.py, I changed my description of the code function into a more detailed one. The original one is simplified that it does not show specific steps.

2. A file called "Reflection.txt" is added in Practical4 folder and it contains my reflections. 

No further improvements except the above two were available according to my formative feedback.
